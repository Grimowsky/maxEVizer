              Most of the staking agreements ends with a disproportion between
              backer’s and player’s end result.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tournament poker is bound with an inevitable scenario of a
              downswing that a backed player will not withstand - either
              financially or mentally. It’s not about the player that much, it’s
              about a magnitude. Everybody has their limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a certain period of good cooperation the large downswing
              comes and as the player digs his make-up deeper:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>you are told that the player decided to quit</li>
              <li>you are told that the player decided to quit</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Either way the make-up will take a large chunk of your profits.
              Often results in an ultimate loss.

              If we assume that the staking’s ‘stop loss’ is constant, the one
              way to increase backer’s end profit would be to increase player’s
              winnings. This time the make-up to split profits ratio will be
              better.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cash games the quickest way to increase one’s profitability is
              to pick the games with weaker players - table selection. This
              simple rule is considered non transferable to tournaments, due to
              hundreds of different games running every day, differentiated by a
              number of both known and unpredictable variables and a vague
              relation between the results of their analysis and final
              profitability.
            </p>
            <p>
              However if we assume it is possible to precisely say which games a
              player should play to maximize his results, the graph will look
              more like this.
